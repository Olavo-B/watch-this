# How it works

One of the fundamental parts of this project is the search engine, that is, the method that will be used to generate recommendations. The initial approach involves the use of a technique known as collaborative filtering, implemented based on cosine similarity and using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
